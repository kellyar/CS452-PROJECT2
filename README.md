CS452-PROJECT2

Alex Kelly & Richard Davis

==============
Due Friday April 18

Note: This program requires "Simple OpenGL Image Library" (SOIL) to be on your system in order to load the texture's image file, get it here

[http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html]

or directly from

[http://www.lonesock.net/files/soil.zip]

To install it: Unzip the file from the above link. Look in "Simple OpenGL Image Library/projects/makefile", then create a directory there called "obj". Now run "make" from commandline where the makefile is and then "make install". That should install the library and header file.

Now our program will be able to compile!
